# Time series projects 

This repository is where all my time series projects will be stored, I will have my project as well as the data used in my repository.

#### Project 1 -- synchronoss technologies stock analyis [beginner level project] 
##### Purpose: 
I am currently in a time series regression course, and I wanted to explore appropriate modelling techniques for time series data, use of forecasting techniques and understanding the process of working with time series data in general. 
This project worked mainly with the closing prices of Synchronoss technologies up until 04 Aug 2022, and the goal of the project was to build a model that helped forecast the closing prices of the stock
